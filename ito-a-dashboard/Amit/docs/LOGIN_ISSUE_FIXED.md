# Login Issue - FIXED! âœ…

## Problem Summary
You were stuck at "Loading your dashboard..." after trying to log in.

## Root Cause
The backend server was **crashing** due to a missing Python package: `google-generativeai`

### What Happened:
1. When you tried to log in, the frontend sent a request to verify your token
2. The backend server tried to import `google.generativeai` from the `recommender.py` file
3. The import failed because the package wasn't installed
4. The backend crashed/reloaded repeatedly
5. The frontend couldn't verify your token, so it stayed in the loading state forever

## Solution Applied

### 1. âœ… Installed Missing Package
```bash
pip3 install google-generativeai
```

### 2. âœ… Restarted Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/phoenix/Documents/MscProject/ito-a-dashboard/Amit/ITOA_Dashboard/src/backend
python3 -m uvicorn app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The backend is now running successfully at http://127.0.0.1:8000

### 3. âœ… Improved Error Handling
Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to handle backend connection failures more gracefully.

## How to Login Now

### Option 1: Clear Browser Cache and Login Again
1. **Open your browser's Developer Tools** (F12 or Right-click â†’ Inspect)
2. **Go to the Application/Storage tab**
3. **Find localStorage** in the left sidebar
4. **Delete these items:**
   - `auth_token`
   - `auth_user`
   - `token` (if it exists)
5. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
6. **Try logging in again** with:
   - Username: `demo`
   - Password: `demo123`

### Option 2: Open in Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new incognito/private browser window
2. Navigate to your application
3. Login with demo credentials

### Option 3: Quick JavaScript Fix
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Paste this command:
```javascript
localStorage.clear(); window.location.reload();
```
3. Login again

## Verify Backend is Running

Check the terminal output - you should see:
```
âœ… Demo user created: username='demo', password='demo123'
âœ… Loaded 1 allowed email(s) from allowed_emails.json
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

## Test Login Steps

1. **Make sure backend is running** (see terminal output above)
2. **Clear localStorage** (use one of the methods above)
3. **Navigate to login page**: http://localhost:3002/login
4. **Enter credentials**:
   - Username: `demo`
   - Password: `demo123`
5. **Click "Sign In"**
6. You should now successfully login! ðŸŽ‰

## What If It Still Doesn't Work?

### Check Backend Status:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```
If this works, the backend is running.

### Check Frontend:
Make sure your frontend is running on port 3002:
```bash
# In the ITOA_Dashboard directory
npm run dev
```

### Check Browser Console:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for error messages
4. Share any errors you see

## Why This Happened

When we added the AI recommendations feature, we:
1. Created `recommender.py` that imports `google.generativeai`
2. Added `from recommender import get_gemini_recommendations` to `app.py`
3. Updated `requirements.txt` to include `google-generativeai`

However, the package wasn't actually installed in your Python environment, causing the import to fail.

## Prevention for Future

Always run after updating `requirements.txt`:
```bash
cd src/backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all required packages.

## Current Server Status

âœ… **Backend**: Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Demo user created successfully
- Email allowlist loaded (1 allowed email)
- All endpoints available
- AI recommendations ready

ðŸ”„ **Frontend**: Should be running on http://localhost:3002

## Summary

**The issue is now FIXED!** Your backend server is running properly. You just need to:
1. Clear your browser's localStorage (remove old invalid token)
2. Login again with demo/demo123

The application should work perfectly now! ðŸš€
