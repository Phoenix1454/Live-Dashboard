3. Ensure Recharts components are imported
4. Check console for Recharts errors

### **If KPIs Show Wrong Values:**
1. Verify `response.kpis` object structure
2. Check format type (number/percentage/currency/duration)
3. Ensure `formatKPIValue` function is working
4. Verify backend calculations are correct
